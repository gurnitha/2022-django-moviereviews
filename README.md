My exercise based on Beginning Django 3 Development by Greg Lim


#### 1. Introduction


        The App We Will Be Building

        We will build a Movie reviews app which lets
        users to:
        -	View and search for movies. 
        -	They can also log in and post reviews on the movies
        -	Users can see the list of reviews in a
	        Movie ’ s page and post/edit/delete their own
	        review if they are logged in. 
        -	They will not be able edit/delete other ’ s reviews though.

        Through this app, we will learn a lot of
        concepts like forms, user authorization,
        permissions, foreign keys and more. By the
        end of this book, you will be confident
        creating your own Django projects.
